# Global-Public-Broadcasting-Providers
A list of public broadcasting providers by country


If you are living in or doing business in a country, you are probably already paying for public broadcasting in the form of a monthly fee or included in your taxes.

Use these services. Or politicians might get the idea to scrap them, and you’ll have less diverse options.

I’ve compiled an (incomplete) list of public broadcasters for a number of countries below, with a focus on their live tv / programmes offerings.
